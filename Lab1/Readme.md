# Image Classification on CIFAR-10
### Neural Networks and Deep Learning Lab ECE NTUA 2023-2024

## Project Overview

This project implements an **Image Classification system** using **Wide Residual Networks** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10** dataset. The goal of the project is to build an effective image classifier by experimenting with different architectures and applying advanced data augmentation techniques.

Key features:
- **Model Architecture Experimentation**: Implementing various configurations of Wide Residual Networks by modifying their depth and width to observe their impact on classification accuracy.
- **Advanced Data Augmentation**: Utilizing the MixUp technique to create synthetic images and enhance the training dataset, leading to improved model generalization.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assessing the model's accuracy and training time on both training and testing sets, ensuring reliable evaluation metrics.
- **Dropout Regularization**: Implementing dropout layers to prevent overfitting and improve model performance.
